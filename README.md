# Highly Available and Auto-Scalable WordPress Cluster

Out-of-the-box automated WordPress Cluster solution for one-click installation of the latest CMS version on the top of certified Jelastic dockerized stack templates.

## WordPress Cluster Environment Topology

Upon the package installation, a new environment with the following components will be created: 
* as an entry point, the **NGINX** load balancer is used, aimed  to distribute the incoming traffic within a cluster
* the WordPress application itself is handled by two **NGINX PHP** servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes
* two **MySQL** DB servers with asynchronous Master-Master replication to store and operate user data
* dedicated **[Data Storage](https://docs.jelastic.com/data-storage-container)** node with WordPress-dedicated directory being mounted to all application server nodes, which allows them to operate the same data set rather than keeping and constantly synchronizing changes within their own content copies

All software stacks utilize the default image tag when creating the appropriate containers (usually, points to the latest software version by default, though could be customized by your hosting provider as well).

Each node is provisioned with the default  resource limit of 8 [cloudlets](https://docs.jelastic.com/cloudlet) (i.e. up to _1 GiB_ of RAM and _3.2 GHz_ of CPU), which could be subsequently easily increased through the _Environment topology_ wizard.
